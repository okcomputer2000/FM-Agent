# Bug Validator Agent Instructions

You are a bug validation agent operating in **single-file mode**. A target result file and bug ID are provided in the prompt header that precedes this document. Your job is to read that single bug report, attempt to confirm the bug by writing and running a concrete test case, and persist the result to disk.

---

## Overview

The target result file is a JSON file produced by a logic verification step. It carries a `"verdict"` field (`"MATCH"` or `"MISMATCH"`) and a `"gaps"` object with supporting evidence. You operate only when `"verdict"` is `"MISMATCH"` **and** `"gaps"` is non-null and non-empty. If the file does not meet these conditions, write a detail file noting the skip and exit.

At the end of your run you must produce:

1. One **detailed Markdown file** at `fm_agent/bug_validation/<bug_id>.md` documenting the result.
2. One **test case file** at `fm_agent/bug_validation/_probe_<bug_id>.<ext>` containing the final probe script.
3. A **single-line result file** at `fm_agent/bug_validation/<bug_id>.result.json` recording the confirmation status (see the end of this document).

---

## Step 1 — Read the Target Result File

Read the JSON file specified in the prompt header. Extract:

- `source_file` — value of the top-level `"function"` key. If the prefix is `"fm_agent/extracted_functions"`, remove that prefix.
- `spec_claim` — value of `gaps.spec_claim`.
- `actual_behavior` — value of `gaps.actual_behavior`.
- `code_evidence` — value of `gaps.code_evidence`.
- `trigger_condition` — value of `gaps.trigger_condition`.

---

## Step 2 — Attempt to Trigger the Bug

**Attempt budget:** make up to **3 attempts** to produce a confirming test case before giving up.

### 2a. Read the Source File

Open the source file identified by the `"function"` field. Read enough of the file to understand the control-flow around the lines cited in `"code_evidence"`.

### 2b. Design a Minimal Test Case

Using `"trigger_condition"` and `"code_evidence"` as your primary guide, and `"spec_claim"` vs `"actual_behavior"` as your oracle, construct a **minimal script** (in the project's primary language) that:

1. Calls the relevant function through the **package entry point** with the inputs described in `"trigger_condition"`.
2. Asserts the **actual (buggy) output** against the **expected (spec-correct) output**.
3. Prints a clear `CONFIRMED` / `NOT CONFIRMED` verdict to stdout when run.

#### Entry-point rule (mandatory)

**Always load the package via its primary public entry point**, not by requiring internal files directly. For example:

- **JavaScript/Node.js:** `require('.')` or `require('./index')`
- **Python:** `import mypackage` or `from mypackage import ...`
- **Go:** use the package's exported symbols via its module path
- **Java/JVM:** instantiate through public constructors or factory methods

Even when the bug lives in an internal helper, the test case must exercise that code path **indirectly** through a public API. Reason from the call stack and the public interface — do not import/require internal implementation files directly.

#### Mapping internal bugs to public entry points

When the buggy function is not itself exported, identify the smallest public API call that exercises the faulty code path. Ask yourself: "Which public function, when called with the right inputs, will reach the buggy lines in `code_evidence`?" Use that function.

If a buggy internal has no single obvious public caller, choose the **simplest public call** whose code path passes through the buggy lines as identified in `"code_evidence"`. Reason from the call stack, not from the module name.

#### Script requirements

The probe script must:
- Be **self-contained** — no network calls, no file I/O beyond loading source modules.
- Load the package exclusively via its public entry point.
- Catch any thrown errors so a crash does not hide the result.
- Print exactly `CONFIRMED` or `NOT CONFIRMED` to stdout (with any additional detail after the keyword).

#### Example structure (JavaScript)

```js
'use strict'

const pkg = require('.')

let actual, expected, passed

try {
  actual   = pkg.someFunction(input1, input2)
  expected = 'spec-correct value'         // what the spec requires
  passed   = actual !== expected           // true → bug reproduced
} catch (err) {
  console.log('ERROR:', err.message)
  process.exit(1)
}

if (passed) {
  console.log('CONFIRMED — actual:', actual, '| expected:', expected)
} else {
  console.log('NOT CONFIRMED — actual matched expected:', actual)
}
```

#### Example structure (Python)

```python
import sys
try:
    import mypackage
    actual   = mypackage.some_function(input1, input2)
    expected = 'spec-correct value'
    passed   = actual != expected
except Exception as e:
    print(f'ERROR: {e}')
    sys.exit(1)

if passed:
    print(f'CONFIRMED — actual: {actual!r} | expected: {expected!r}')
else:
    print(f'NOT CONFIRMED — actual matched expected: {actual!r}')
```

> **Do not use any test framework** (Jest, pytest, JUnit, etc.) for these probe scripts. Plain language runtime only.

### 2c. Write the Script to a Temporary File

Write the probe script to `fm_agent/bug_validation/_probe_<bug_id>.<ext>`, where:
- `<bug_id>` is the bug ID provided in the prompt header.
- `<ext>` is the appropriate file extension for the project's language (`.js`, `.py`, `.go`, etc.).

### 2d. Execute the Script

Run the script from the **repo root** so that the entry-point import resolves correctly:

```bash
# JavaScript / Node.js
node fm_agent/bug_validation/_probe_<bug_id>.js

# Python
python3 fm_agent/bug_validation/_probe_<bug_id>.py

# Go, Java, etc. — use the appropriate run/compile-and-run command
```

Capture both stdout and the exit code.

### 2e. Classify the Result and Retry if Needed

Based on the output:

| stdout contains | Classification |
|---|---|
| `CONFIRMED` | **confirmed** — stop retrying; the bug is reproduced |
| `NOT CONFIRMED` | **not_confirmed** — see retry rules below |
| `ERROR` or non-zero exit | **error** — see retry rules below |

**Retry rules:**

- If the result is `confirmed`, record it and proceed to Step 3.
- If the result is `not_confirmed` or `error`, revise the test case (different input values, adjusted assertion, or fixed script error) and repeat from step 2b. Count this as the next attempt.
- After **3 attempts** (or `--max-attempts` if overridden) without a `confirmed` result, stop retrying. Record the final classification (`not_confirmed` or `error`) and the stdout from the last attempt.
- Each attempt overwrites the same `_probe_<bug_id>.<ext>` file — do not create numbered copies.

The `attempts` count must be recorded in the result JSON file (see Step 3).

**Final classification (last attempt's output):**

| Last stdout contains | Final classification |
|---|---|
| `NOT CONFIRMED` | **not_confirmed** — could not reproduce the bug within the attempt budget |
| `ERROR` or non-zero exit | **error** — all attempts ended in a script error; record the last error message |

Record the final classification, the raw stdout of the last attempt, and the total number of attempts made.

## Step 3 — Write Detail and Result Files

After confirming or exhausting attempts, create the following output files.

### Detail Markdown file

Create a Markdown file at:

```
fm_agent/bug_validation/<bug_id>.md
```

Where `<bug_id>` is the bug ID provided in the prompt header.

Each file must contain the following sections in order:

````markdown
# Bug Report: <FunctionName>

**Source file:** `<value of "function" field>`
**Verdict:** MISMATCH
**Confirmation status:** confirmed | not_confirmed | error

---

## Reasoning Process

The following actual behavior cannot satisfy the specification.

### Specification Claim

<value of gaps.spec_claim — verbatim>

---

### Actual Behavior

<value of gaps.actual_behavior — verbatim>

---

## Code Evidence

<value of gaps.code_evidence — verbatim>

---

## Trigger Condition

<value of gaps.trigger_condition — verbatim>

---

## How to trigger the bug

Describe the concrete inputs used in the probe, what the buggy code returns, and what the specification requires.

### Inputs

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| … | … |

### Expected (spec-correct) Output

`<expected value>`

### Actual (buggy) Output

`<actual value returned by the code>`

### How to Reproduce

Step-by-step instructions to trigger the bug manually:

1. Navigate to the repo root.
2. Run the following snippet (uses the package entry point):

```<language>
<minimal reproduction code using the public API>
// actual (buggy) output: <value>
// expected (correct) output: <value>
```

---

## Probe Script

```<language>
<full contents of the probe script written in Step 2c>
```

### Probe Output

```
<raw stdout from Step 2d>
```
````

---

### Result JSON file

After writing the detail Markdown file, write a small result file at:

```
fm_agent/bug_validation/<bug_id>.result.json
```

with the following schema:

```json
{
  "id": "<bug_id>",
  "source_file": "<value of function field>",
  "function_name": "<base name>",
  "confirmation_status": "confirmed | not_confirmed | error",
  "attempts": "<integer — number of test-case attempts made, 1-10>",
  "probe_script": "fm_agent/bug_validation/_probe_<bug_id>.<ext>",
  "detail_file": "fm_agent/bug_validation/<bug_id>.md",
  "probe_stdout": "<raw stdout of the last attempt — single line, escape newlines as \\n>",
  "trigger_summary": "<one-sentence summary of the trigger condition>"
}
```

---

## Step 4 — Cleanup (Optional)

After the result files are written, you may delete the temporary `_probe_*` file from `fm_agent/bug_validation/` if it is no longer needed. Retain it if the caller has requested verbose output.

---

## Output Directory Layout (Expected Final State)

```
fm_agent/bug_validation/
  <bug_id>.md                                   ← detail Markdown file (Step 3)
  <bug_id>.result.json                          ← result JSON file (Step 3)
  _probe_<bug_id>.<ext>                         ← retained unless cleanup was performed
```

---

## Constraints and Rules

1. **Always use the `bug_id` provided in the prompt header for all output filenames** — probe scripts, detail Markdown file, and result JSON file.
2. **Do not modify any source file** in the repository. You are a read-only observer of the source code.
3. **Do not modify any file** under `fm_agent/logic_verification_results/`. Treat it as immutable input.
4. **Do not modify existing test files** in the repository's test suite.
5. **Do not run the full test suite** as part of this workflow — it is slow and unrelated to bug confirmation.
6. Probe scripts must be **self-contained** — no network calls, no file I/O beyond loading source modules via the language's standard import mechanism.
7. If the `fm_agent/bug_validation/` directory does not exist, create it before writing any files.
8. **Default attempt budget is 10 per bug.** Override with `--max-attempts <N>` if needed. Never exceed the budget; never skip retrying if attempts remain and the result is not yet `confirmed`.
9. If a probe script throws an unhandled exception, catch it, classify the result as `"error"`, and count it as one attempt. Retry if the budget allows.
10. All Markdown files must use **fenced code blocks** with appropriate language tags (`js`, `py`, `go`, `json`, etc.).
11. The result JSON file must be **valid JSON** (no trailing commas, no comments).

| `spec_claim` | Target result JSON file | The oracle for "what should happen" (Step 2b) |
| `actual_behavior` | Target result JSON file | Understand the buggy control flow (Step 2b) |
| `code_evidence` | Target result JSON file | Pinpoint the exact lines to target (Step 2b) |
| `trigger_condition` | Target result JSON file | Derive the concrete input(s) for the probe (Step 2b) |
